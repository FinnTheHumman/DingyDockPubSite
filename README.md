Seamus Murphy Read Me Final

Here is the Link to my site on the dev server: https://dev.itas.ca/~seamus.murphy/ITAS191_FINAL_Seamus.murphy/index.html
</h3>
<h2>
Validation Issues:
</h2>
<h3>
Index.html : It did not like my site icon, I moved it around to see what it wanted to be a "child" of, but I just couldn't figure out where it wanted to go.
</h3>
<h3>
Conactus.html : The issues I had here were my lable tags not wanting to be a child element of anything. Every time I tried to make it a "child" of anything else, the site just wouldn't work. The validator also says I have a stray footer tag that I also couldn't figure out. And I had the same site icon problem.
</h3>
<h3>
About.html : The same site icon problem.
</h3>
<h3>
 Products.html : The same site icon problem.
</h3>
<h3>
Store.html : The same site icon problem.

<h2>
CSS Changes
</h2>
<h3>
1. The contactus.html css imbedded in the html document was created by me from the ground up to suit my needs.
</h3>
<h3>
2. Color was changed in line 9,8,69,73,79,90,130,199,212,213,218,219 of business-casual.min.css.
</h3>
<h3>
3.Image changed on line 12 of business-casual.min.css.
</h3>
<h3>
I used a bootsrap template called Business Casual: https://startbootstrap.com/themes/business-casual/. The main changes I made to its html was to change the color scheme and the images.
</h3>
<h2>
Further Content I'd Add
</h2>
<h3>
If I had more time I would make the submit button in the contact us page preform a function to send an email containing the contents of the contact us inputs. I would also add another page for upcoming events like live music and such. I would add additional styling to my Contact Us page, its functional but not very pretty. I would add commenting to the page. I think id also add more photos I of the interior of the pub (I could not find any good photos of the inside). Perhaps even add some photos of the food/drink. 
</h3>
<h2>
Color Wheel Implementation
</h2>
<h3>
I used the adobe color wheel tool found here: https://color.adobe.com/create. I uploaded the background photo of my site and had it make a color pallet from that. I thought that it was a good idea since the image is on every page of my site, so the color theme would work well.
</h3>
<h2>
Additional Features I'd add
</h2>
<h3>
I would also add some sort of scroll effect. I tried to add one but for some reason I never got it to work properly, pretty unfortunate because that would have added a more modern and impressive feel.

<h2>
General Feedback
</h2>
<h3>
Your lectures tended to be a bit long, unfortunately I have no idea what the fix for this would be. Also demonstrations that don't work and require some jerry rigging from you really impedes the "flow" of the lecture. Your one on one teaching is phenomenal, I never hesitated to ask for help and you always helped me to the best of your ability in a very instructional and engaging way. I can not stress how much of an asset your one on one teaching is. I would have liked to have focused a bit more on the creative side of website building, aesthetics and so forth. Your talks on "dark web" or "criminal" activity on the web were very engaging and interesting, I found myself drawn in every time. I went into this course knowing very little html or css and cant believe how far ive come under your teaching, the progress we have all made is outstanding, I hope you feel proud of what your students have been able to accomplish.
